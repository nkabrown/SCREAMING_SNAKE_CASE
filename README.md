====================

Flushing Web Development Club
-----------------------------

A growing set of plans for a high-school aged, Flushing-based, coding club
which hopes to be volunteer-run and free to attend. Currently an imaginative
entity that might someday be a reality. 

###Target Audience

Don’t want this to be a guys who play internet games 24/7 and never see the light of day 
kind of club. Materials that appeal to design-minded, creative, artistic kids. Just as appealing and 
welcoming to girls as guys. 

###Development Goals

Take young coders from no knowledge to intermediate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Design and 
build attractive websites based on coder’s own individual interests.

###Location

Hip location, avoid the appearance of a classroom or internet cafe, welcoming, aspirational, and fun space,
e.g., a space like [BARREL](http://www.barrelny.com/about/the-barrel-office/) offices (I’m allowed to dream). Creative negotiation may be required due to little or no budget for rent. :(

###Format

Every session: short instruction, coding together, fun project that puts instruction to work,
one fun thing you can get your computer to do.
* Length = ? hour-and-a-half
* Pair programming = ?

###Time

Saturdays 10:30–12:00 ?

###Code of Conduct

Need to develop a simple Code of Conduct that high-schoolers can understand and follow.
